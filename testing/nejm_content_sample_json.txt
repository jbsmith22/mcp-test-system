The rest is spent navigating bureaucracy, reviewing disorganized data, coordinating care, speaking with families, and reacting to misaligned system incentives.”<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r1\">1</xref></sup> This statistic captures the daily reality of the modern clinician — a profession increasingly fragmented by its own infrastructure.</p><p>As physicians and as innovators, we must see this as both a warning and a call to design. AI should not merely outperform us on question-and-answer benchmarks; it should help restore the conditions for genuine human care. The physician’s burden is no longer a lack of medical knowledge, but the inefficiency of systems that separate knowledge from action.</p><p>Gallifant and Bitterman correctly identify that “the challenge is shifting from whether machines can know as much as or even more than humans to how we measure and govern their ability to act wisely and in alignment with human values.”<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r1\">1</xref></sup> For doctors who code, this is the defining task: to translate clinical wisdom into code that embodies ethical awareness, contextual judgment, and respect for the patient narrative.</p><p>For physicians who are developers, this is the defining task: to translate clinical wisdom into code that reflects ethical insight, contextual understanding, and a deep respect for the patient’s story.</p><p>We should focus our technical energy on the unglamorous 60% of the physician’s day — the bureaucracy, the data chaos, the unseen coordination. These are not peripheral problems; they are the human bottlenecks where care quality and compassion often break down. Building systems that understand context, reduce cognitive load, and preserve trust will matter more than beating exam scores.</p><p>The “next medical exam” will test not only machine intelligence, but also our capacity to align technology with humanity. Physicians who code must ensure that what we build does not distance us further from our patients but brings us closer to the bedside — in time, attention, and empathy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type=\"financial-disclosure\"><p><xref ref-type=\"app\" rid=\"ap3\">Disclosure forms</xref> provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app content-type=\"disclosures\" id=\"ap3\"><title>Disclosure Forms</title><supplementary-material mimetype=\"application/pdf\" xlink:href=\"AIp2501185_disclosures.pdf\"/></app></app-group><ref-list><label>Reference</label><ref id=\"r1\"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><person-group person-group-type=\"author\"><string-name><surname>Gallifant</surname> <given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Bitterman</surname> <given-names>DS</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Humanity’s next medical exam: preparing to evaluate superhuman systems</article-title>. <source>NEJM AI</source> <year>2025</year>;<volume>2</volume>(<issue>11</issue>).
