peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have revolutionized treatment of diabetes and obesity, generating meaningful improvements in glycemic control, weight, cardiovascular health, and kidney disease. Because of high prices and the large population eligible for treatment, however, this new class of medications has caused drug expenditures to soar.</p>\n<p>Total U.S. spending on GLP-1 drugs increased by more than 500% since 2018, exceeding $71 billion in 2023.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r1\">1</xref></sup> Of this total, $50 billion was spent on two medications: semaglutide and tirzepatide.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r1\">1</xref></sup> Rapid GLP-1 spending growth has led payers to raise insurance premiums, impose strict criteria for access, or simply decide not to cover these drugs. For example, the North Carolina state health plan terminated coverage of GLP-1 agonists for obesity in 2024 in part because continued coverage would require across-the-board premium increases of nearly $50 per month for teachers and state employees. Limited insurance coverage has led some patients to consider purchasing these drugs directly from manufacturers, but many cannot afford hundreds of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs each month.</p>\n<p>Nationwide, spending on this single drug class is contributing to rising health insurance costs that hinder wage growth, slow hiring, and crowd out business and government investment in other priorities. Driven by these pressures, in November 2025, the Trump administration announced a deal with the GLP-1 manufacturers, providing expanded Medicare coverage and expedited Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of unapproved products in exchange for discounted GLP-1 prices in Medicare and Medicaid. Though expanded access is a welcome development, broader use of these drugs will further stretch the budgets of these public programs. Moreover, the deal did not address GLP-1 prices for private insurers including employers, which sponsor coverage for the majority of Americans.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, patent protection for one of the earliest GLP-1 medications — liraglutide — expired in 2024, paving the way for generic competition. Liraglutide was initially approved for type 2 diabetes in 2010 (under the brand name Victoza) and at higher doses for obesity in 2014 (Saxenda); the first interchangeable generic products launched in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The availability of a lower-cost generic GLP-1 agonist presents an opportunity to expand access to this drug class while mitigating the associated financial burden.</p>\n<p>Soon after liraglutide was approved, it became the most-prescribed GLP-1 agonist, but it has since been overtaken by newer products (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f1\">graphs</xref>) — first dulaglutide (Trulicity), then semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), and most recently tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound), which is a combined GLP-1 receptor agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist. By 2025, liraglutide accounted for approximately 1% of GLP-1 prescriptions in the United States.</p>\n<p>This shift away from liraglutide was driven by multiple factors. The newer GLP-1 drugs are more effective and have more convenient weekly dosing than liraglutide, which requires daily injections. Yet newer GLP-1 agents were priced similarly to liraglutide, which made them an easy first choice for patients and payers. These pricing decisions by manufacturers were most likely strategic. For example, Novo Nordisk benefited from encouraging patients and prescribers to switch to its newer product (semaglutide), which had longer remaining patent exclusivity than its older one (liraglutide).</p>\n<p>The market entry of generic liraglutide could meaningfully reduce the fiscal burden of GLP-1 drug coverage, but only if patients, clinicians, and insurers choose to leverage this opportunity. Although overall use of liraglutide is low, use of its generic versions is growing, accounting for 76% of all liraglutide prescriptions in the second quarter of 2025. Prices have decreased, but they have not yet fallen substantially because only three manufacturers produce generic liraglutide for diabetes and only one produces generic liraglutide for obesity in the United States as of December 2025. If liraglutide use remains limited, other companies may remain on the sidelines, triggering a vicious cycle of sparse competition that fails to further lower prices and thus entrenches the limited uptake of these products.</p>\n<p>If generic versions are embraced by patients, clinicians, and payers, however, increased use would most likely draw additional manufacturers into the market. This additional competition would further drive down prices, which in turn would generate more demand and foster broader use. The result of this virtuous cycle would be expanded access to an effective GLP-1 agonist at a fraction of the cost of brand-name semaglutide or tirzepatide.</p>\n<p>Though there has understandably been greater clinical interest in the newer agents, overlooking liraglutide now that generic versions are available would be a mistake.</p>\n<p>Liraglutide’s efficacy and safety are well established. Trial results supporting its FDA approval demonstrated clinically meaningful glycated hemoglobin reductions, weight loss, and — in patients with diabetes — lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes. Open-label head-to-head trials funded by Novo Nordisk showed more pronounced effects with semaglutide than with liraglutide in diabetes (change in glycated hemoglobin level, −1.7% vs. −1.0%)<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r2\">2</xref></sup> and obesity (change in weight, −15.8% vs. −6.4%).<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r3\">3</xref></sup> Unlike semaglutide and tirzepatide, liraglutide was never tested for its cardiovascular benefits in patients with obesity but not diabetes and, because of generic entry, probably never will be. However, liraglutide improves blood pressure, lipid profiles, and other cardiometabolic markers in such patients.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r4\">4</xref></sup></p>\n<p>Although reductions in weight and glycated hemoglobin levels with liraglutide are smaller than those achieved with semaglutide or tirzepatide, some cardioprotective benefits of GLP-1 drugs are mediated by mechanisms independent of weight and glycemic control, such as modification of vascular biology and reduction of systemic inflammation. Trials of liraglutide demonstrated reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation associated with increased cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r4\">4</xref></sup></p>\n<p>Liraglutide’s side-effect profile is also similar to those of newer GLP-1 agents, with some studies even finding that liraglutide was associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal side effects and treatment discontinuation than semaglutide.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r2\">2</xref></sup> But the daily dosing of liraglutide could pose problems for adherence, and in at least one trial, patients were more likely to discontinue liraglutide than semaglutide when taken for obesity.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r3\">3</xref></sup></p>\n<p>When all GLP-1 drugs were brand-name only and similarly priced, it was reasonable for patients and clinicians to select the most effective agents. Now that liraglutide has generic equivalents, however, the higher efficacy of semaglutide and tirzepatide must be weighed against their higher cost. This question of cost-effectiveness could be answered empirically. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that semaglutide and tirzepatide were cost-effective for treating obesity when compared with lifestyle modifications, but this analysis did not compare these products with a generic GLP-1 agonist.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"r5\">5</xref></sup></p>\n<p>In the absence of formal cost-effectiveness analyses, the growing number of public and private health plans opting to heavily restrict or terminate GLP-1 coverage suggests there is a role for a lower-priced option, even if it’s less convenient and efficacious. As prescription-drug spending continues to outpace inflation, straining public budgets and limiting wage growth for working families, the availability of a generic GLP-1 provides a rare chance to broaden access to an effective pharmaceutical intervention that will benefit millions of Americans, without sacrificing the imperative to be responsible stewards of limited resources.</p>\n<p>Near-term availability of affordable GLP-1 agents may hinge on whether insurers, patients, and clinicians give generic liraglutide that chance. Doing so will require insurers to add generic liraglutide to their formularies and consider giving it preference over semaglutide or tirzepatide. Payers that have opted not to cover all weight-loss medications because of cost constraints could reconsider that decision given the availability of a generic GLP-1 drug, particularly as more manufacturers enter the market and generic prices fall. Professional societies should clearly delineate the role for generic liraglutide in treatment guidelines, which are increasingly considering the costs of therapies in addition to their safety and effectiveness. Finally, researchers should assist payers by evaluating the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide and tirzepatide relative to generic liraglutide.</p>\n<p>The United States grants monopoly protection to new drugs for a limited period, allowing manufacturers to charge high prices to recoup investment in research at the expense of affordability. Once these protections expire, prices drop and access expands. For GLP-1 drugs, that time could be now.</p>\n</body>\n<back>\n<notes>\n<p content-type=\"published/updated\">This article was published on December 10, 2025, at NEJM.org.</p>\n</notes>\n<fn-group>\n<fn fn-type=\"financial-disclosure\">\n<p><xref ref-type=\"app\" rid=\"ap1\">Disclosure forms</xref> provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</p>\n</fn>\n</fn-group>\n<app-group>\n<app content-type=\"disclosures\" id=\"ap1\">\n<title>Disclosure Forms</title>\n<supplementary-material mimetype=\"application/pdf\" xlink:href=\"NEJMp2515668_disclosures.pdf\"/>\n</app>\n</app-group>\n<ref-list>\n<label>References</label>\n<ref id=\"r1\"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><string-name><surname>Tsipas</surname> <given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Khan</surname> <given-names>T</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Loustalot</surname> <given-names>F</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Myftari</surname> <given-names>K</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Wozniak</surname> <given-names>G</given-names></string-name>. <article-title>Spending on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among US adults.</article-title> <source>JAMA Netw Open</source> <year>2025</year>;<volume>8</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>e252964</fpage>-<lpage>e252964</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type=\"pmid\">40172891</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref>\n<ref id=\"r2\"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><string-name><surname>Capehorn</surname> <given-names>MS</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Catarig</surname> <given-names>A-M</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Furberg</surname> <given-names>JK</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title>Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 1.0mg vs once-daily liraglutide 1.2mg as add-on to 1-3 oral antidiabetic drugs in subjects with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 10).</article-title> <source>Diabetes Metab</source> <year>2020</year>;<volume>46</volume>:<fpage>100</fpage>-<lpage>109</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type=\"pmid\">31539622</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref>\n<ref id=\"r3\"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><string-name><surname>Rubino</surname> <given-names>DM</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Greenway</surname> <given-names>FL</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Khalid</surname> <given-names>U</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title>Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs. daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial.</article-title> <source>JAMA</source> <year>2022</year>;<volume>327</volume>:<fpage>138</fpage>-<lpage>150</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type=\"pmid\">35015037</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref>\n<ref id=\"r4\"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"journal\"><string-name><surname>Pi-Sunyer</surname> <given-names>X</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Astrup</surname> <given-names>A</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Fujioka</surname> <given-names>K</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title>A randomized, controlled trial of 3.0 mg of liraglutide in weight management.</article-title> <source>N Engl J Med</source> <year>2015</year>;<volume>373</volume>:<fpage>11</fpage>-<lpage>22</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type=\"pmid\">26132939</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref>\n<ref id=\"r5\"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type=\"eref\"><string-name><surname>Lin</surname> <given-names>GA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Lee</surname> <given-names>W</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Fahim</surname> <given-names>SM</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title>Semaglutide and tirsepatide for obesity: effectiveness and value</article-title>. <publisher-loc>Boston</publisher-loc>: <source>Institute for Clinical and Economic Review</source>, <month>September</month> <day>9</day>, <year>2025</year> (<uri xlink:href=\"https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICER_Obesity_Draft-Report_For-Publication_090925.pdf\">https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICER_Obesity_Draft-Report_For-Publication_090925.pdf</uri>).</mixed-citation></ref>\n</ref-list>\n</back>\n<floats-group>\n<fig id=\"f1\" position=\"float\">\n<caption>\n<title>U.S. Prescriptions for GLP-1 Agonists for Type 2 Diabetes (Panel A) and Obesity (Panel B), 2010–2025.</title>\n<p>Data are estimated numbers of prescriptions filled each quarter, according to Symphony Health Metys.
